# Create Your Own Microprocessor

Create a simple microprocessor that supports 11 instructions with multi-cycle machine. The instruction set is a subset of PicoBlaze to make compile simple. To test the microprocessor, an assembly code to generate nth fibonacci number is created and inserted into the design. Simulation proves the design is correct. A bit file can be generated using ISE and download it into Nexys3 (Spartan-6). LEDs in Nexys3 can be used to display nth fibonacci number (not implemented in the source code). The source code used bcd_display module in LightSevenSegment folder to display nth fibonacci number in seven-segment.
